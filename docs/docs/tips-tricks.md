# Tips and Tricks

## Custom Fields

Custom fields are a great way to add any extra information to your item. The following types are supported:

- [x] Text
- [ ] Integer (Future)
- [ ] Boolean (Future)
- [ ] Timestamp (Future)

Custom fields are appended to the main details section of your item.

!!! tip
    Homebox Custom Fields also have special support for URLs. Provide a URL (`https://google.com`) and it will be automatically converted to a clickable link in the UI. Optionally, you can also use markdown syntax to add a custom text to the button. `[Google](https://google.com)`
